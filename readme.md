**Generate secret key**
To generate secret key use `from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key` then `get_random_secret_key()` in your python shell

**Note:** don't forget to set the sites to your domain instead of example.com in the admin panel

### Create a firebase credential file

>**Note:** We'll be using firebase for persistent storage, to upload user files. Firebase is pre-configured as there are other firebase services developers may want to use. <br><br> You can also use any of the storage supported by [django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages), if you don't want to use firebase.

To use Firebase

1. We use Google storage for storing files. Go to firebase -> storage -> create (make it public)

2. Now Go to firebase -> project settings -> service account -> Generate new private key.

Rename the private as `firebase-cred.json`

Use this private file as your credential file.

#### Deploying credential file to production
Sometimes your cloud provider may not provide you with storage for secret files. 
So convert the credential file to base64 using
```
base64 firebase-cred.json > encoded.txt
```
Now copy the contents of encoded.txt and paste it in `FIREBASE_ENCODED="wedde"` variable
